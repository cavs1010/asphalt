<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This project aimed to propose feasible Machine Learning models that can predict the performance of pavements after plastic waste addition. These models could be helpful for professionals that are evaluating the use of plastic waste in the construction of flexible pavement. The properties predicted were Air Voids, Marshall Stability, Marshall Flow, and Indirect Tensile Strength.</p><br>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>The data was collected from different scientific articles that have studied the topic since 2011. It included different plastic types and the two principal mixing techniques (dry and wet). A variety of features were included as data for training the ML models -> Aggregates gradation, type of bitumen, plastic-type added, percentage of plastic, mixing technique, and others.</p><br>
